# Moonshine Quantum Internet v3.5

World record geometric quantum computing on 196,883-node Moonshine manifold. Tested between Rigetti Ankaa-3 and aer successfully. Data and code is in /proofs-progs/

Run lattice_builder_python.py for moonshine.db, connect with hardware and its supplies genuine quantumness to the lattice(if it isn't already a quantum-classical interface as is...)

## Features
- W state tripartite layered entanglement stored in a sqlite db. 
- σ-coordinate and j-invariant routing
- Integrated keep-alive system

## Deploy
See deployment instructions in repository.
